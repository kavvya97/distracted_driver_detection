# Distracted Driver Detection

A Deep learning project for detecting distracted drivers using the Distracted Driver Dataset.

## Introduction
Distracted driving is a major concern that significantly impacts road safety. This project aims to develop a solution for detecting distracted drivers using machine learning techniques. 

## Dataset
The Distracted Driver Dataset, available on Kaggle, serves as the foundation for our project.\

## Approach
- Implemented prelimnary baseline methods using resnet50 and densenet121 pretrained model
- Autoencoder approach to get the image latent space and derive the most important characterstics of the image.
- Semantic Segmentation of the images
- Ensemble methods using pretrained models like VGGnet, Resnet and densenet.
